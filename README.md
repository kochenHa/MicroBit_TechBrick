# MicroBit_TechBrick

**A substitute for the discontinued LEGO Mindstorms, designed to work with the BBC Micro:Bit and LEGO-compatible components.**

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a replacement for the discontinued LEGO Mindstorms, leveraging 3D-printable designs and the BBC Micro:Bit. The system is designed to integrate seamlessly with LEGO Technic components and bring an affordable, flexible, and customizable solution for robotics enthusiasts, educators, and students.

## Technical Objectives
- **Research** existing solutions and technologies to integrate with
- **Define System Architecture**
- **Select Connection Methods**:
  - Use robust cables and connectors to ensure durability, especially for children.
- **Choose a Controller** suited for the project
- Establish **Pin Configuration** for connections

## Components

This project aims to ensure full compatibility with LEGO Technic bricks. All components will be designed to fit a **8 mm x 8 mm grid**.

### Control Brick
- **Central Unit**: Houses the power supply and programmable microcontroller.
- **3D-Printed Case**: Enclosed in a case that can connect to LEGO parts.
- **Expandable Design**: Allows additional modules to connect via connectors.
- **Wireless Communication**: Enables remote control of the Control Brick.

### Add-On Modules
A variety of add-on modules will be available:
- **Servomotor**
- **DC Motor**
- **Push Button**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**
- **Optical Sensor**

Add-on modules will use **easily accessible parts** (e.g., model-building components) to ensure affordability and availability. With all components you should be able to create at least a line following robot code and blueprints will be provided once available.

## How to Get Started

1. **Download the Micro:Bit MakeCode Environment**  
   Use the [Microsoft MakeCode for Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) to start programming the Control Brick.

2. **3D Print Components**  
   All 3D models for the Control Brick and add-ons will be provided in this repository.

3. **Assemble and Connect**  
   Follow the documentation to assemble the Control Brick and attach add-ons.
